## A trip for a Mexican Beach.

A friend and I were wonthering if sublet an apartments/houses after put it for short rental business was a good idea? 

This is a complex qustion to answer bc you have so many variable to rely on to know if where you are puting your money is going to return. 

We find out that during the pandemic people had more time to travel due to HO or the families had kinds full times (without school). The big cities that provide most of our custumer were Mexico City and Puebla that they are not famous providing a lot of space for families. Mos of the apartment in Mexico city are 75m2 for four people. Checkout the population of Mexico cities [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Mexico)

The problem was that we do not have enogh data to make good desitions. So we put our data skill to the work. The city that we are going to analys is Acapulco a town in the pacific cost of Mexico.

## Working_data.

The data is comming of a flat file (.CSV) for a scrapy service that continuous check airbnb properties listings and when this are book. You can find the rough data in this link [here](https://github.com/Vicsolorz/vicsolorz.github.io/blob/master/_data/font-awesome/available_listings_table.csv)

## Cleaning and set up the Data 

I create a dictionary call mapping to consolidate the Studio and Room value in the column Beedroom to have a consolidate number of one bedroom apartment. I remove in Star Rating column the NA and Unkonown values there were less than 3% of the data and are apartment with no reviews, change the type of the column as float. 

Create the Rooms column appling the mapping dictionaries mention erlier. 

Remove some outliers from the data. 

Setting logic to determine what type of host it is. Airbnb define supper host with some criteria you can check it [here](https://www.airbnb.mx/superhost/terms) Basically had more than 10 guests, more than 4.8 of rating and be active at least a Quarter. This variables are the number of reviews, Raiting and the Active Nights the properties where offer in the year. 

## Let explore our data -- Some GrAphs!
