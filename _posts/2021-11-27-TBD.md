## A trip for a Mexican Beach.

A friend and I were wonthering if sublet an apartments/houses after put it for short rental business was a good idea? 

This is a complex qustion to answer bc you have so many variable to rely on to know if where you are puting your money is going to return. 

We find out that during the pandemic people had more time to travel due to HO or the families had kinds full times (without school). The big cities that provide most of our custumer were Mexico City and Puebla that they are not famous providing a lot of space for families. Mos of the apartment in Mexico city are 75m2 for four people. Checkout the population of Mexico cities [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Mexico)

The problem was that we do not have enogh data to make good desitions. So we put our data skill to the work. The city that we got our data is Acapulco a town in the pacific cost of Mexico. The data we adquiere in a scrape service but you can do the same. 

## Working_data.

The data is comming of a flat file (.CSV) for a scrapy service that continuous check airbnb properties listings and when this are book. You can find the rough data in this link [here](https://github.com/Vicsolorz/vicsolorz.github.io/blob/master/_data/font-awesome/available_listings_table.csv)

## Cleaning and set up the Data 

First we need to understand the data that we are going to be working. The data type is as follow: 

 0    ListingID       1000 non-null   int64  
 1   Link             1000 non-null   object 
 2   lat              1000 non-null   float64
 3   lng              1000 non-null   float64
 4   Bedrooms         1000 non-null   object 
 5   Star Rating      1000 non-null   object 
 6   Reviews          1000 non-null   int64  
 7   Price            1000 non-null   int64  
 8   Occupancy        1000 non-null   int64  
 9   Revenue          1000 non-null   int64  
 10  Active Nights    1000 non-null   int64  
 11  Min Stay         1000 non-null   int64  
 12  Dynamic Pricing  1000 non-null   object 
 13  id               1000 non-null   int64 



Let give a litle contest of the variables. 

##Â ListingID 

It is a number for control of the scrapy service. 

## Link

Is the link of the property

## Lat & lng 

These are gps coordanate. 

## Bedrooms 

The number of bedrooms the property has. 

## Star Rating 

The grade that you have in Airbnb system. 

## Reviews

Counts the number of reviews a property has. 

## Price 

It's an average of price per night. 

## Occupancy

The percentage of occupancy

## Revenue 

Is the sales per night that property has made since is beeing track. 

## Active nights 

Is the number of nights available for rent. 




I create a dictionary call mapping to consolidate the Studio and Room value in the column Beedroom to have a consolidate number of one bedroom apartment. I remove in Star Rating column the NA and Unkonown values there were less than 3% of the data and are apartment with no reviews, change the type of the column as float. 

Create the Rooms column appling the mapping dictionaries mention erlier. 

Remove some outliers from the data. 

Setting logic to determine what type of host it is. Airbnb define supper host with some criteria you can check it [here](https://www.airbnb.mx/superhost/terms) Basically had more than 10 guests, more than 4.8 of rating and be active at least a Quarter. This variables are the number of reviews, Raiting and the Active Nights the properties where offer in the year. 

## Let explore our data -- Some GrAphs! 

Histogram of Bedrooms distribution 

![Hist_BR](/assets/Hist_BR.png)) 

Scatter Plot. I cross the type of bedrooms vs the mothly revenue to find out more thing about the data. 

![Scatter](/assets/scatter_BR_RevMonth.png)

With these two graph we saw that the two and three bedrooms apartment are going to be earning a monthly revenue between 50kmn to 100kmxn and that the four bedroom apartment It will have revenue above the 100kmxn. This due to the number of properties. This mean big parties but the downside will be the caring of the apartment. With bigger groups apartments tend to care less. 

I wished to take a closer look to the mothly distribution of each type of apartment. Let take a look only for 2,3,4 and 5 beedrooms.
