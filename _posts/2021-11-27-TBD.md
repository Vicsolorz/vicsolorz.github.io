## A trip for a Mexican Beach.

A friend and I were wonthering if sublet an apartments/houses after put it for short rental business was a good idea? 

This is a complex qustion to answer bc you have so many variable to rely on to know if where you are puting your money is going to return. 

We find out that during the pandemic people had more time to travel due to HO or the families had kinds full times (without school). The big cities that provide most of our custumer were Mexico City and Puebla that they are not famous providing a lot of space for families. Mos of the apartment in Mexico city are 75m2 for four people. Checkout the population of Mexico cities [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Mexico)

The problem was that we do not have enogh data to make good desitions. So we put our data skill to the work. The city that we are going to analys is Acapulco a town in the pacific cost of Mexico.

## Working_data.

The data is comming of a flat file (.CSV) for a scrapy service that continuous check airbnb properties listings and when this are book. You can find the rough data in this link [here](https://github.com/Vicsolorz/vicsolorz.github.io/blob/master/_data/font-awesome/available_listings_table.csv)

## Cleaning and set up the Data 

I create a dictionary call mapping to consolidate the Studio and Room value in the column Beedroom to have a consolidate number of one bedroom apartment. I remove in Star Rating column the NA and Unkonown values there were less than 3% of the data and are apartment with no reviews, change the type of the column as float. 

Create the Rooms column appling the mapping dictionaries mention erlier. 

Removing outliers from the data. Most of these outliers are new data of data that is wrong in the data gathering.  

Setting logic to determine what type of host it is. Airbnb define supper host with some criteria you can check it [here](https://www.airbnb.mx/superhost/terms) Basically had more than 10 guests, more than 4.8 of rating and be active at least a Quarter. This variables are the number of reviews, Raiting and the Active Nights the properties where offer in the year. 

## Let explore our data -- Some GrAphs! 

Histogram of Bedrooms distribution 

![Hist_BR](/assets/Hist_BR.png)) 

Scatter Plot. I cross the type of bedrooms vs the mothly revenue to find out more thing about the data. 

![Scatter](/assets/scatter_BR_RevMonth.png)

With these two graph we saw that the two and three bedrooms apartment are going to be earning a monthly revenue between 50kmn to 100kmxn and that the four bedroom apartment It will have revenue above the 100kmxn. This due to the number of properties. This mean big parties but the downside will be the caring of the apartment. With bigger groups apartments tend to care less.

![Hist of market](assets/hist_in_a_glance.png)

In these histograms we can give us an idea about how the market is doing. Just by watching each variable we know that airbnb is not going to allowed some grading below 4 or you probably are going to star having some trouble. Most of the market has good grade so the competition is a factor. We can se that most apartents are recently new with less than 50 reviews so the market is still learning althoug if we compare the Active_Nights variable are more than 100 available nights per apartmnet this has to do for the demand on the area. 

Pricing per night the mean per night is arround $2,500 to $3,000 just premium real state can rent it greater than $5,000 or more.
